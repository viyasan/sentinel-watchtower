# WatchTowr — Wealthsimple AI Builder Application

## What the human can now do that they couldn't before

A single compliance analyst can now manage an investigation queue that previously required a team of three to four people. WatchTowr synthesizes intelligence from seven vendor systems — Plaid, Flinks, TRM Labs, Elliptic, Chainalysis, Persona, and ComplyAdvantage — into a unified workspace where every data point relevant to a case is surfaced in one view. Instead of spending hours pulling transaction records, cross-referencing watchlists, and manually drafting regulatory narratives, the analyst receives AI-generated case summaries, pre-drafted STR/LVCTR/EFTR filings using the WHO/WHAT/WHEN/WHERE/WHY/HOW framework that FINTRAC requires, and confidence-rated typology matches against known money laundering and terrorist financing indicators. The analyst's time shifts from data gathering to judgment — reviewing AI work, making filing decisions, and handling the edge cases that require human intuition.

## What AI is responsible for

AI handles the operational heavy lifting across the investigation lifecycle. It performs cross-system intelligence synthesis, pulling and correlating data from all connected vendor feeds into a coherent risk picture. It runs pattern recognition across behavioral data — identifying structuring patterns, rapid movement of funds, dormant account reactivation, and other FINTRAC typology indicators — and assigns confidence ratings to each match. AI drafts complete regulatory narratives for Suspicious Transaction Reports, Large Value Cash Transaction Reports, and Electronic Funds Transfer Reports, structured to meet FINTRAC's reporting standards. It calculates risk trajectories over time, monitors SLA deadlines in real-time, and flags cases approaching breach. During investigation, AI surfaces the specific transactions, counterparties, and behavioral signals that triggered each risk flag, so the analyst can verify rather than discover.

## Where AI must stop

The filing decision — whether to submit an STR, LVCTR, or dismiss a case — must remain with the human analyst. FINTRAC holds the reporting entity and its compliance officers personally liable for filing decisions. AI can surface every piece of evidence and draft a complete narrative, but the judgment of whether observed behavior constitutes "suspicious" activity requires human assessment of intent. This is not a technical limitation but a regulatory one: the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act places accountability on individuals, not systems. WatchTowr enforces this boundary with a mandatory decision bar where the analyst must actively select a disposition. The QA review step — where a Team Lead approves or returns a case — provides a second human checkpoint before any filing reaches FINTRAC.

## What would break first at scale

AI confidence calibration. As case volume grows from dozens to thousands of daily investigations, the system must maintain precision in its risk scoring without human review of every AI assessment. False negatives — cases where suspicious activity is missed — carry regulatory penalties and reputational damage. False positives waste analyst time and erode trust in the system's recommendations. The calibration feature built into WatchTowr (where team members independently assess borderline cases and reach consensus) is designed to address exactly this, but it requires continuous human feedback loops. At scale, the challenge becomes ensuring that calibration data keeps pace with evolving criminal typologies and that the AI's confidence thresholds remain aligned with the team's risk appetite. Without this feedback mechanism, model drift would silently degrade investigation quality.
